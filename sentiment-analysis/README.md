## Observations

### Code structure

My understanding is that most of the code should be included in **App.tsx**. I took the liberty to create some _types_ file, _aws-config_ and other little helpers. But all the "React" code can be found in App.tsx.

I didn't go crazy for small componenta that can be composed etc. I kept it simple.

I hope I understood correctly üòÖ

### Code styling

I didn't spend much time on styling so the App has a quite rudimentar UI. Also the CSS can be found in the global file. Nothing fancy here
